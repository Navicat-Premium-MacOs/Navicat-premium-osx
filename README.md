## Why Navicat Premium?

Navicat Premium brings your MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, SQLite, and MongoDB into a single, streamlined toolkit. Instead of juggling separate utilities for each engine, you get one consistent workflow for modeling, querying, transferring, auditing, and scheduling tasks.

**Who benefits**
- **DBAs** who need reliable schema control and routine automation  
- **Developers** building features across mixed stacks and cloud services  
- **Data analysts** exploring datasets and turning results into shareable visuals

---

## Quick Highlights

- **Multi-engine hub**: Work with different databases concurrently in one app  
- **Visual design & SQL**: Diagram joins visually or write fine-grained queries with a smart editor  
- **Transfer & sync**: Move data and structures between engines with mapping and preview  
- **Backups on rails**: Schedule dumps, verify integrity, and keep restore playbooks ready  
- **Exploration to insight**: Transform query results into charts and exportable reports  
- **Cross-platform**: macOS, Windows, Linux (same toolset and interface logic)

## First Run: From Zero to Connected

1. **Create Connection** → pick your engine  
2. Fill in **Host / Port / Username / Password** (+ DB name if needed)  
3. Toggle **SSH** or **SSL/TLS** when your server requires it  
4. Click **Test** to validate; **Save** the profile  
5. Open the connection panel → browse objects, open the **Query** editor, and run your first statement

> Tip: Color-code connections (Dev / Staging / Prod) to avoid cross-environment mistakes.

---

## Everyday Workflows

### 1) Inspect & Edit
- Browse tables, documents, indexes, triggers, routines  
- Inline editing for small corrections; use scripts for bulk operations

### 2) Import / Export
- Import from CSV/TSV, Excel, JSON, XML to a new or existing table  
- Export results or whole tables to CSV/Excel/JSON/SQL dumps  
- Save import/export **profiles** for one-click repetition or scheduled runs

### 3) Modeling & Querying
- **Visual Query Builder** for quick joins/filters/grouping  
- **SQL Editor** with syntax highlighting, snippets, and execution plans  
- Parameter prompts for reusable analytics templates

### 4) Transfer & Synchronize
- **Data Transfer** with mapping rules, batching, and verification  
- **Structure Synchronization** to keep schemas aligned across environments

---

## Object Designers (Built-In)

- **Tables**: columns, types, defaults, constraints, comments  
- **Views**: design visually or from SQL  
- **Routines**: stored procedures and functions with validation  
- **Events/Jobs**: time-based triggers at the engine level  
- **Users/Roles**: grant and audit privileges

---

## Automation & Job Scheduling

Turn any transfer, export, or sync profile into a scheduled job:
- Flexible frequencies (hourly / daily / weekly / custom)  
- Email or log-based notifications on completion/failure  
- Centralized run history for auditing and troubleshooting

---

## Security & Connectivity

- **SSH tunneling** for private networks and bastion-host setups  
- **SSL/TLS** with CA bundles and client certificates where required  
- **Least privilege**: connect using roles scoped to the task at hand  
- Secure credential handling and periodic rotation recommended

> Always align with your organization’s security policy and compliance standards.

---

## Performance Playbook

- Use `EXPLAIN` to spot full scans and missing indexes  
- Add composite indexes for common filter/sort paths  
- Partition large time-series or archival tables  
- Keep OLTP sets lean; move cold data to cheaper storage  
- Verify network latency and server I/O before chasing query changes

---

## Team Tips

- Adopt naming conventions (tables, columns, constraints)  
- Version control DDL/DML scripts with your application code  
- Separate Dev/Staging/Prod connections; apply color cues  
- Share import/export and transfer **profiles** to standardize operations

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

| Symptom | Checks |
|---|---|
| **Connection fails** | Firewall/VPN, security groups, host/port, SSL/SSH prerequisites, server logs |
| **SSL handshake error** | Certificate trust chain, protocol/cipher compatibility, hostname verification |
| **Slow queries** | `EXPLAIN`, indexes, pagination, result set size, server CPU/RAM/I/O, network round-trip |
| **Schema drift** | Use **Structure Synchronization** and schedule checks after deploys |

## Keyboard Shortcuts (macOS)

- Run query: **⌘R**  
- New query: **⌘N**  
- Format SQL: **⌥⌘L**  
- Find: **⌘F**  
- Stop execution: **⌘.**  
*(Windows/Linux: use **Ctrl** equivalents.)*

---

## Supported Engines & Connectivity

- **Relational**: MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, SQLite  
- **Document**: MongoDB  
- **Cloud**: Amazon RDS/Aurora, Azure Database, Google Cloud SQL, Alibaba Cloud (via drivers)  
- **Tunnels/Encryption**: SSH, HTTP tunnel, SSL/TLS, VPN-friendly

---

## System Requirements (macOS)

- macOS 10.13 High Sierra or newer (Ventura & Sonoma supported)  
- Intel or Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)  
- 2 GB RAM minimum

---

## FAQ

**Can I work with multiple connections at once?**  
Yes. Open several connections in parallel; tabs help you keep context.

**Does it handle cross-engine migration?**  
Use **Data Transfer** for mappings and **Structure Sync** for DDL. Preview scripts before running.

**How do I automate recurring exports?**  
Save an export profile, then schedule a **Job** with notifications.

**Best way to keep environments aligned?**  
Run **Structure Synchronization** routinely and gate releases on a “clean diff.”

---

## Learning Path (General)

- Start with your engine’s official docs (MySQL/PostgreSQL/Oracle/SQL Server/MongoDB)  
- Practice `EXPLAIN` and indexing strategies on sample datasets  
- Save profiles and templates to turn ad-hoc tasks into repeatable flows

---

## Changelog (Example Format)

- **Editor**: faster autocomplete, better lint messages  
- **Connectivity**: clearer SSH/SSL diagnostics  
- **Transfer**: higher throughput on large batches  
- **Designers**: improved constraint validation and diffs  
- **UX**: tab pinning, theme refinements, accessibility tweaks
